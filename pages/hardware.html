						I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not

						“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
						make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I
						signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
						thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
						Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
						Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

					<p class="card__intro">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
					<p class="card__review">
						“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
						structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
						encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
						things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
						were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
						project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
						way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
						interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
						job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”

						“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
